            Musical instruments are special devices that produce various tunes and melodies, which combine to form music. In fact, any object or device that can create a harmonious sound can be regarded as a musical instrument.
          </p>
          <p>
            The history of musical instruments dates back to as far as 67,000 years ago. The oldest object that is referred to as a musical instrument by some scholars is a flute.
          </p>

            The classification of musical instruments is a disciple in its own right. There have been many classifications of musical instruments to date. Most of them have tried to classify the musical instruments based on various factors, such as their effective range, size, role, and the composition of the material used.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, the most widely accepted classification of musical instruments is the way they produce sound. The study of musical instruments is known as organology.

            If you are interested in learning musical instruments, you must familiarize yourself with all of their types. Even if you are not interested in playing one, it is still exhilarating to explore different musical instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            It will help you to decide what kind of learning you wish to attain in the niche of music. So, here is the list of all the major classes of musical instruments.

            In this type of musical instrument, all you need to do is blow into the musical instrument by following a defined order to produce a particular kind of sound. These instruments essentially work on the principles of sound waves, resonance, and harmonics. We can control the frequencies, and acoustics can be set and altered by changing how we blow into the instrument and what order we follow.

            There is a wide variety of wind instruments that can be seen around the world. Some of the highly renowned wind instruments are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flute</li>
            <li>Oboe</li>
            <li>Clarinet</li>
            <li>Bassoon</li>

            The instruments that fall in this category consist of strings that can be vibrated to produce different sounds with varying pitches. The pitch of the sound produced via these instruments is highly dependent on the length of the air column inside the instrument. The pitch also significantly depends upon the thickness of the strings used in the instrument.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some examples of string instruments include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guitar</li>
            <li>Violin</li>
            <li>Viola</li>
            <li>Double Bass</li>
            <li>Cello</li>
            <li>Harp</li>

            Percussion instruments are the musical instruments in which sound is produced by beating or scraping them using a beater, hand, or a similar instrument. These instruments are broadly divided into two classes:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Pitched Percussion</strong> instruments are instruments that produce notes with an identifiable pitch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unpitched Percussion</strong> instruments are the ones that produce notes with a pitch that is not identifiable.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These instruments are a bit tricky to play because it takes a lot of experience and practice to be able to hit the instrument with the right amount of intensity for a given tone. These instruments are widely used as they are quite melodic and make special sounds that add excitement and vibrance to the atmosphere. Some examples are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Piano</li>
            <li>Triangle</li>
            <li>Tambourine</li>
            <li>Chimes</li>
            <li>Cymbals</li>
          </ul>

            All of the instruments that have been stated up until now are conventional ones that require a lot of human effort and technique. For example, most instruments demand the musician to either blow into them or vibrate their strings using fingers or fingernails.

            But, some modern instruments work on the principles of electronics. These instruments are infused with the latest technology. The central point of attraction to these instruments is that they require minimal effort from the musician, so they are relatively easy to use.

            These musical instruments are user-friendly, so the musician does not have to spend much of his/her time in practice so as to master the basics of producing sounds from them.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the most popular electronic instruments are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rhythm Machines</li>
            <li>Octopods</li>
            <li>Samplers</li>
            <li>synthesizers</li>
            <li>Piano Keyboards</li>
